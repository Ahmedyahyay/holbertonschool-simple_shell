.SH NAME
simple_shell \- Simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsimple_shell\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsimple_shell\fR is a basic command line interpreter modeled after the standard sh shell. It displays a prompt and executes commands entered by the user. The shell supports both interactive and non-interactive modes.
.PP
In interactive mode, it displays the prompt `($) ` and waits for user input. After executing a command, the prompt is displayed again.
.PP
Commands are executed by searching for the executable in the directories listed in the \fBPATH\fR environment variable. If the command includes a path (e.g., `/bin/ls`), the \fBPATH\fR is not searched.
.PP
The shell handles command line arguments passed to the executables.
.PP
It supports the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D), which terminates the shell.
.PP
The following built-in commands are implemented:
.SH BUILTINS
.TP
\fBexit\fR [\fIstatus\fR]
Terminate the \fBsimple_shell\fR process. If an argument \fIstatus\fR (an integer) is provided, the shell exits with that status. Otherwise, it exits with the status of the last command executed. (Note: argument handling for exit might be implemented in later versions).
.TP
\fBenv\fR
Print the current environment variables, one per line, in the format `variable=value`.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBPATH\fR
A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for executable commands.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell exits with status 0 on successful execution of the `exit` command without an argument, or upon receiving EOF (Ctrl+D). If the `exit` command is given an integer argument \fIstatus\fR, the shell exits with that status. If a command cannot be found or fails to execute, a non-zero status is implicitly returned (typically related to the error). Error messages are printed to standard error.
.SH BUGS
No known bugs. Limitations include lack of support for pipelines, redirections, logical operators (&&, ||), command separators (;), quoting, and other advanced shell features.
